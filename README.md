INSTRUCTION FOR USAGE

I have saved the webscraping code as a Python file (.py), then executed it using powershell.
This creates a data file named data_file.txt in the directory of the python file.
I manually copy the data_file into the directory of the Processing program (the path is printed the in console of the processingcode).
When the data file is in the directory, the processing code runs and displays the visual representation.

Note: The webscraping file uses the module Selenium. I used the chrome webdriver. You have to have that setup for this code to work.
