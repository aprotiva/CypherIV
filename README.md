INSTRUCTION FOR USAGE

I have saved the webscraping code as a Python file (.py), then executed it using powershell.
This creates a data file named dtat_file in the directory of the python file.
I manually copy the data_file into the directory of the Processing program (the path is printed the in console of the processingcode).
When the data file is in the directory, the processing code runs and displays the visual representation.
